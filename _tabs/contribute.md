All participants of the [Wikimedia Hackathon 2023](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Hackathon_2023){:target="_blank"} are welcome to contribute to this blog.
Being Jekyll + Github Pages based, contributions can be submitted in the form of `Pull requests` to [https://github.com/wmhack2023/wmhack2023.github.io](https://github.com/wmhack2023/wmhack2023.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

Contributions can be posts about sessions one has participated, general experience about participating in the Hackathon, account of achievements during the Hackathon, introduction of collaboration teams, etc.

On practical terms in order to propose a contribution prepare a Jekyll **`post`** and follow instructions on how to create a pull request:
+ [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui){:target="_blank"}
+ [https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github){:target="_blank"}  

or approach in person volunteers supporting this blog. Accepted contributions need to, at least, be:
+ in `.md` format 
+ placed in the `_posts` repo folder
+ include in the front matter of the md file a link to your `https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:` page
+ if your post includes photos, these are only accepted if linked from Wikimedia Commons

If still in doubt regarding what a Jekyll post looks like, clone an existing one from the [`_posts` folder](https://github.com/wmhack2023/wmhack2023.github.io/tree/main/_posts){:target="_blank"} and adapt appropriately. If you run into trouble try consulting existing Q&A in the repo's [Discussions](https://github.com/wmhack2023/wmhack2023.github.io/discussions){:target="_blank"} or submit a new Question in this discussions area or reach out to us.

The volunteers supporting this blog will do their best to keep track of contributions and coordinate blogging effort.
